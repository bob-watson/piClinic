Notes on logging workflows for performance measurement

Write to file as is done for profile and error logs.

Log the following data
	workflowName : [login, admit, discharge, report_<name>, patient_add, patient_edit, visit_edit]
	contextID: GUID to identify workflow across files and requests
	stepName: Workflow step (in multi-step workflows) All workflows must have 'start' and 'end'.
	scriptName: PHP file name 
	username: Username logged in at the time
	clockTime: Date/Time (to second) of log entry
	logTime: microtime of log entry
	
	
EX:
	login, XXX, start, clinicLogin.php, USER1, 2019-08-07 15:32:22, 1565191942.2223
	login, XXX, end, clinicLogin.php, USER1, 2019-08-07 15:32:24, 1565191944.1223
	
	Specific Login workflow time = delta logTime
	
Functions
	contextID = logWorkflowStart (workflowName)
		stepName = start
		scriptName =  __FILE__
		username = username parameter, username from session, or token
		clockTime & logTime from system
		
	logWorkflowStep (workflowName, contextID, stepName)
		scriptName =  __FILE__
		username = username parameter, username from session, or token
		clockTime & logTime from system
		
	logWorkflowEnd (workflowName, contextID)
		stepName = end
		scriptName =  __FILE__
		username = username parameter, username from session, or token
		clockTime & logTime from system

	writeWorkflowLogEntry (workflowDataObject)
		(contains the data fields described above)
