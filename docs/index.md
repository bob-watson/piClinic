# _piClinic_

![piClinic Console - Front]({{site.baseurl}}/images/TermFront-piclinic_sm.jpg)

The _**piClinic**_ is an open-source, patient-record automation solution designed for limited-resource healthcare clinics around the world. _**piClinic**_ systems fill the gap between a paper-based patient-record system and a complete Electronic Health Record (EHR) system at a very low cost per system.

The _**piClinic**_  is built on [the digital principles]({{site.baseurl}}/principles/) to provide an accessible, sustainable, and low-cost solution.

## Benefits

Many small clinics around the world would benefit from some form of patient-record automation to reduce duplicate and misplaced files and improve their ability to report on patients and clinic activities. However, for many of these clinics, an EHR system is too costl to install and too complex to  maintain. 

_**piClinic**_ provides the essential patient-record automation functions of:

* Electronic patient master index
* Digital archiving of patient records
* Patient visit tracking and record-keeping
* Basic patient and clinic operation and summary reports

Introducing a _**piClinic**_ system to a clinic helps the clinic enjoy the benefits of better organization and automated reporting quickly, while preparing the clinic and its systems to move to a more comprehensive EHR in the future.

## Current status

The _**piClinic** Console_ is currently being field-tested in four clinics in Honduras.

For more detailed information and the current status, contact the project's principal investigator, Robert Watson at [watson_rb@mercer.edu](mailto://watson_rb@mercer.edu).
