# _piClinic_ Vision

The _**piClinic**_ provides a low-cost solution that is built on [the digital principles]({{site.baseurl}}/principles/) to help clinics automate their existing paper patient record system and patient-visit reporting. Adopting a _**piClinic**_ system provides immediate reporting benefits while preparing the clinic to move to an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system in the future.

Clinics can adopt the _**piClinic**_ system and functionality that best fits their existing patient and record workflow and the system can grow with the clinic.

## _piClinic_ Benefits

Moving from a paper-based patient ID and record system to a _**piClinic**_ system helps clinics organize their workflow, periodic reporting, and patient record keeping. The _**piClinic**_ system's design supports the customer at their current level of organization and guides them through increasing levels of organization and automation. The levels of automation that the _**piClinic** Console_ supports are, in order from most basic to most sophisticated:

### Automating the Clinic's Patient Master Index

Entering patients into the automated Patient Master Index of a _**piClinic** Console_, helps a clinic identify patient information more quickly, maintain up-to-date patient information, and eliminate duplicate and incorrect patient information.

### Automating the Clinic's Daily Patient Log

As a clinic begins to track their patients in the Clinic's Patient Master Index, they can then keep an accurate log of the patients who have visited the clinic. _**piClinic**_ systems track patients as they are admitted to and discharged from the clinic. The _**piClinic**_ system maintains a summary of each visit, which provides a quick view of the patient's clinic history. The diagnoses from these visits are coded using the ICD-10 diagnoses codes and they can be reported in daily logs of activity as well as in periodic summaries.

### Automating periodic Clinic reports

By coding the diagnoses at the time of the patient's visit, _**piClinic**_ systems can provide accurate and timely summaries of clinic activities. Periodic reports and statistical summaries of clinic activity can be prepared in seconds instead of days.
