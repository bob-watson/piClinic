## Notes

### HDMI Monitor

The Raspberry Pi should work with any LCD monitor with an HDMI input. If the part linked in the table is not available, or another monitor was found with better price or availability, it can be used. The VESA Mount Case cannot be screwed to monitors that do not support a VESA mount (the four screws on the back of the monitor and set at 75mm or 100mm apart).

**NOTE:** It is easier to attach the parts to monitors with flat backs than to those with curved back surfaces.

### CPU board

The **Raspberry Pi 3 (Model B)** is required for this configuration. The software is not supported on other systems; however, you are certainly welcome to experiment, if that's your interest. 

**NOTE:** Do not substitute this part with earlier models of the Raspberry Pi. Earlier models do not have the performance to support this software. Later models will likely work, but might require more power.

### CPU case

The VESA mount case provides a neat, convenient, and secure mount for the CPU board. While this is not required to operate the system, it make the system more reliable by holding all the parts and cables in one place.

### Mouse and keyboard

These are generic parts and may be substituted with any other USB mouse and/or keyboard (for example, one with a layout suitable to the local language).

### Power strip

This is optional, but it provides a neat way to secure the cables while providing a single on/off switch for the user.

### CPU power cable

This is a generic USB-A male to USB-micro B cable. It may be substituted with any similar cable.

### CPU SDHC card

This card is the heart of the system and should only be replaced by a card that has the same or higher performance. Less expensive cards, if used, are likely to reduce the performance of the system to the point of not being usable. 

A card with 32GB of space should provide a small clinic with sufficient capacity for several years. Cards with 64GB capacity have also been tested. In addition to the capacity of the card, a card with read/write performace of up to 95MB/s read; up to 90MB/s write speed or better should be used.

### USB connectors

This extension USB port is to provide easy access to the USB ports of the Raspbery Pi for download and backup. It also protects the USB ports of the Raspberry Pi from damage from insertions and removals by providing additional ports off of the board.

Use of this part is recommended to ensure longer, reliable service from the Raspberry Pi CPU board.

### CPU clock module

This is required when using the Raspberry Pi to keep the correct time. The Raspberry Pi system requires this component or a connection to the Internet in order to maintain accurate time keeping. For systems that are not connected to the Internet continuously, this component must be used to maintain accurate system time.

Note, field testing suggests that modules with replaceable backup batteries might provide a more sustainable design.

### UPS battery backup

This is required in environments with unreliable electrical power. The system listed here will power the system with the monitor on for about an hour. With the monitor switched off, it will power the CPU board for about a day.

### Mounting Hardware

The following hardware is used to secure the cables and components to prevent damage and unreliable operation that can result from excessive movement and vibration.

* Cable mounts
* Mounting tape
* Cable ties
* Cable tube
* Connector protection (USB)
* Connector protection (RJ45/network)
