## Field Test Overview

| -------- | -------- |
| **LOCATION** | Three small clinics on [Roatán, Honduras](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Roatán,+Honduras) and one small clinic near [San Esteban, Honduras](https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Esteban,+Honduras). |
| **DATES** | May 1 to July 31, 2019 |

## Project summary

**The goal** of the field test is to test the research question:

| Can a low-cost patient-information system improve the reporting efficiency and data access of patient information in small clinics? |

**Key findings**

1. **The system was easy to learn and use** Clinic staff in all the clincs tested became proficient in the routine clinic operations very quickly. Typically in less than a week; however, in some clinics it took the clinicians just a few days to feel confident using the system.

2. **The standalone system was not enough** The original design was to employ only a single console system as the only automation hardware. The field test demonstrated that this complicated the clinic workflows in the test clinics. The preferred configuration that we tested in the field was to use the console as a local server and allow other clinic stations, such as triage and the doctor's office, to access the patient information as the patient went through the clinic.


## Project details

**The method** to answer this question, is to install the system in small clinics and observe if it helps them with their patient-information management.

Because this test is still very much exploratory in nature, we were especially interested in these qualitative observations:

* **Ease of adoption** If the system is hard to learn, any benefits that it might provide would not be accessible to the users.

* **Improvement in clinic operations** If the system doesn't make their the clinicians' jobs easier, then there's not much point to using it over the current systems they know.

* **Improving the access** to a clinic's information can help the clinic find new ways to make the best use of their limited resources. 

**On this trip**, we will install prototype patient record automation systems in three not-for-profit clinics on the island of [Roatán, Honduras](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Roatán,+Honduras). These systems will ease the clinics’ paperwork burden and provide the clinics’ with a more detailed awareness of patient health, which, together will help these clinics provide better service to the patients they serve. Your work on this project will help take this project to the next level such that it will be able to help many more clinics.

**Most of the work** performed on this trip will be interacting with the clinic staff to train and observing them as they adapt to the new systems. The systems being installed are pre-production prototypes, so collecting notes and observations on how the clinic staff adapts the new systems will be a priority task. 


## Who

* **Anyone** with an interest in clinical information systems or enjoys teaching and working with people. 
* There are a few positions for more technically-inclined students and we’ll need a social media expert, as well. 
* This would be an **excellent opportunity** to practice your medical or business Spanish with native speakers in a real-world context; however, most of the clinic staff with whom you’ll interact speak both English and Spanish.

## A day in the life

* **Week 1**: Get to know the island and the clinics. Take baseline observations of clinic processes.
* **Week 2**: Install systems and help clinics get started with them.
* **Week 3**: Observe the clinics after using the system for a week.
* **Weekends**: Excursions around the island.

## When 

* 1st session of summer semester, 2019

## Where

* [Roatán](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Roatán,+Honduras) is the largest of the Bay Islands of Honduras. Located in the Caribbean Sea, 40 miles north of the Honduran mainland, Roatán is home to the largest barrier reef in the northern hemisphere. 
* While the island is a popular cruise ship destination and famous for its amazing snorkeling and diving, it also home to thousands of people who live in extreme poverty. 
* The clinics in which we will be working are supported by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to serve the many patients who have very limited means.

## Global impact
* Around the world, healthcare clinics with limited resources in remote locations can care for thousands of patients each year. The economic and geographic limitations under which these clinics operate leave many of them keeping patient records on paper, storing them in folders on shelves, and manually tabulating patient and clinic data.
* While paper records are functional, they can suffer from such problems as duplicate and lost records, difficulty in identifying larger patterns in healthcare, and other inefficiencies that can impact the quality of patient care. 
* The _**piClinic**_ console being tested during this mission will help these clinics start automating their records to improve the patient care they can deliver and prepare them for more advanced systems in the future.
